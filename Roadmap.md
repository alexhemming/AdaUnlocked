# Roadmap
## Project mission & summary:
> We are working with educational communities to make puzzle games, so that young people can learn digital skills, engage in the world wide web safely and contribute to the development of a healthy internet.

Our goal is to create a locked box puzzle challenge, that can be played as a team, which has digitial puzzles that get the players thinking and learning about decentralisation, digital Inclusion, openness, privacy and security. The players will need to slove all of the digital puzzles, in order to generate the code to unlock their box and access the treasure within.
