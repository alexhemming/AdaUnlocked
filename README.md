## AdaUnlocked! 🔓

### 👋Hello world 🌍
**Welcome to the AdaUnlocked project!**
Hi, I'm Alex and I teach computer science to young people at Ada, the National College for Digital Skills in London, UK. I am passionate about creating learning experiences, tools and workshops that will allow our young people to get actively involved in the digital sector and develop the skills they need to become digital pioneers.

The AdaUnlocked! project is part of this ongoing mission and it is awesome that you are taking the time to read about us. **We would love to have you join us as a contributor. 🤟** If the idea of joining us on our epic adventure has lit a fire in you, then please read on and I will explain the project and how you can get involved.

### Project description:
#### 🔮 The vision:
> We are working with educational communities to make puzzle games, so that young people can learn digital skills, engage in the world wide web safely and contribute to the development of a healthy internet .

#### 🤔 The problem:
Young people switch off when subjects like decentralisation, digital Inclusion, openness, privacy and security are raised.

They don’t know why these areas are relevant to them, what they should be doing or what actions they can take as an individual to get engaged in building a healthy internet.

#### 💡 Our solution:
We want to create a locked box puzzle challenge, that can be played as a team, which has digitial puzzles that get the players thinking and learning about decentralisation, digital Inclusion, openness, privacy and security. The players will need to slove all of the digital puzzles, in order to generate the code to unlock their box and access the treasure within.

The treasure will be a takeaway resource which they can use to create their own digital puzzles which they can use to challenege their friends, family with and showcase on their own github portfolio.

#### 😜 What makes us different:
AdaUnlocked! will allow young people to learn and understand difficult concepts through completing puzzles. 

The inclusion of a real world element, through the locked box they can only open once they have discovered the code by solving all the puzzles, will ignite their curiosity and engage them in the challenge. 

In addition players can take part in this challenge in teams, allowing them to develop their skills in collaboration and also compete against other teams to solve the challenge first.

Once AdaUnlocked! has been solved, the players can then become the creators, as their unlocked treasure will be takeaway resources that allow them to develop their own puzzles to challenge others with.
